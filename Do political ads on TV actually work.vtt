00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.040
"I drove trucks." "I've been a paperboy."
"I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm."

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.130
An estimated $2 billion or more will be spent
on political ads for the 2014 midterms. And

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.740
with the surge of outside money unleashed
by the Supreme Court in 2010, we can only

4
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.740
expect to see more of these ads going forward.
So you might wonder: Do these ads even work?

5
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.560
TV spot ads for political campaigns date back
to 1952.

6
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.880
It didn't take long for TV ads to go negative, a trend that's worsening still.

7
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.880
An infamous 1964 ad from Lyndon Johnson's campaign suggested his opponent would start a nuclear war.

8
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.980
"These are the stakes." Johnson soon won in a landslide,

9
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.980
but it wasn't because of the ad. He was even
further ahead before it aired. These ads can

10
00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.499
be so vivid and memorable that it's easy to
overstate their influence. But studies on

11
00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.190
whether or not they matter are surprisingly
murky. Think about how small the target is:

12
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.190
Ads work if they persuade those few Americans
who vote but lack political allegiances and

13
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.860
also live in a state or a district where the
election might be a close call. So it's a

14
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.770
hard topic to research. The available studies
find limited effects of ads in a few cases.

15
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.770
But by one estimate, having a massive ad advantage
delivered only half of a percentage point

16
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.800
advantage in vote share in the 2008 presidential
election. Ads had an even smaller effect in

17
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.900
2004. In one real-world experiment during
the early months of Rick Perry's 2006 governor

18
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.710
reelection campaign, researchers randomly
assigned this ad to certain media markets

19
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.800
in Texas. "I'm proud of Texas. How bout you?"
They conducted a poll afterwards and found

20
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.260
stronger support for Perry in the areas that
saw the ad, but only during the week it aired.

21
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.410
By the following week, the effects had disappeared.
They only examined positive ads though. Might

22
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.210
negative ads work better? "Found in a strip
club." "Toasted the Chinese Vice President."

23
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.210
"Obamacare." The most comprehensive review
so far concluded that negative ads are more

24
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.110
memorable, but hurt the attacker as often
as they help. It's not necessarily so irrational

25
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.190
though that candidates spend so much money
on ads. Even if there's no guarantee that

26
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.110
ads can swing a race, there's only a few ways
a campaign can get its message in front of

27
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.110
voters. If the race is close, even half a
percentage point might make a difference.
